# Digit classifier

## What is this project?

Following project was created for the algorithms and data structure course. The main functionality of the application will be to recognize user-written digits using convolutional neural network (CNN for short).

## UI and implementation

The project will be implemented as a web app, using ReactJS for the frontend and Django-restframework as the backend. In the beggining as a scratchwork CNN will be implemented using scikit-learn. Later, however, it will be refactored and optimised from scratch.
