# What was done?

Setup of frontend-backend communication, in particular image upload and convertion. Other than that initial setup of the CNN was done.

# Progress?

Training and testing CNN. Commmunication between frontend and backend is done properly, there are no bugs present.

# What did I learn?

I learned how to properly manage image transfer between frontend-backend of the web app.

# What was problematic?

The image submition was challenging. Also deciding on how to properly manage testing of the CNN was quite challenging.

# Next?

Train CNN and then make a draft implemetation of own CNN. The results should also be displayed to the user. Last part would be the implementation of testing.

# Total time spent this week

Approx: 6 hours

# NB!

As the actual dataset is quite large, it won't be pushed to the repository
