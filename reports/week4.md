# What was done?

1. Main functionality of application is done
2. Implemeted simple backend testing
3. Testing documentation
4. CNN documentation

# Progress?

For the most part the application right now is in working state and actually does what it supposed to. There are simple backend tests implemented at this point that will require some changes in the future (for example a clean-up of uploaded image)

# What did I learn?

I have learned how to combine both tests for the cnn and backend api calls.

# What was problematic?

To begin with - making tests run. Due to the amount of dependencies it was hard to configure settings properly. Secodnly, actually coming up with more or less appropriate way of testing was also rather challenging as again - we are dealing with images and their uploads. Current implementation still is far away from being perfect, but there are some ideas on how to improve it.

# Next?

Improvement of testing, adding test coverage tool and start to implement own CNN.

# Total time spent this week

Approx: 10 hours
