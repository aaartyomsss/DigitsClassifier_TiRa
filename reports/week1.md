# What was done?

Initial setup of the project. This included:

1. Choosing stack for frontend and backend. (React + Django restframework)
2. Dockerizing application
3. Bugfixing

Rest of the time that was spent was planning and documentating the project.

# Progress?

In terms of the actual development - very little has been done. However, with the fundemental stuff that has been further development will be easier and most importantly - it will be easier for people reviewing to setup the project.

# What did I learn?

Again, as very basic stuff has been done - not much was learned. But I got to revise markdown and docker :)

# What was problematic?

Setting the boundaries was probably the hardest part. How difficult and advanced the project should be? What should be the main focus? Actual implementation or the analysis of the solution? And as a result I am still left rather in the unknown, whether my topic is complex enough, even though it has been approved by the TA.

# Next?

Main plan is to _bring application to life_. Provide simple, yet working UI. Basic functionality of the algorithm should be also done, using 3rd party library. If there is time left: NN implementation should be revisited.

# Total time spent this week

Approx: 10 hours
